# SORT-Real-Time-Object-Tracking
Real-time object tracking refers to the process of locating and moving objects in a video stream using computer vision algorithms. This can be done using various techniques such as background subtraction, [Kalman filters](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX2gX-ftPVXU3oUFNATxGXY90AULiqnWT), and deep learning-based object detection models. The goal of real-time object tracking is to accurately and efficiently locate and track objects in a video stream with minimal delay. This technology is used in a wide range of applications such as surveillance, self-driving cars, and augmented reality.
